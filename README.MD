# GraftNode

**GraftNode** is a core component of the [Plantarium Platform](https://github.com/plantarium-platform), a lightweight and resource-efficient solution inspired by cloud architecture principles, designed for running serverless functions and microservices.

It is a Go-based service that dynamically starts backend service instances only when needed, optimizing resource usage. It integrates with HAProxy for request routing and works with lightweight processes to minimize resource consumption.

## How It Works

### Initial Setup (Cold Start)
- HAProxy is initially configured with a mock backend that doesn’t route to the actual service.
- When the first request to `/hello` is received:
    - GraftNode starts the Java service instance defined in `config-example.yaml`.
    - HAProxy's configuration is updated to route requests to the newly started service.
- The first request might experience a delay due to the service startup time.

### After Warm-Up
- Once the service instance is running, subsequent requests are handled immediately, ensuring optimal performance.
- HAProxy now routes directly to the active service.

## Project Structure

Below is the simplified file structure of the GraftNode project:

```plaintext
.
├── services
│   ├── config.go           # Handles service configuration parsing and management
│   ├── executor.go         # Manages execution of service instances
│   └── haproxy
│       ├── haproxy_client.go       # HAProxy API client implementation
│       ├── haproxy_config_manager.go # Manages HAProxy configuration through API
│       └── middleware.go           # Middleware for handling API requests
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── main.go
└── resources
   ├── config-example.yaml     # Example configuration file for GraftNode
   ├── java-service-example.jar # Example Java service binary
   ├── test.sh                 # Script for testing functionality
   └── haproxy
       ├── haproxy-run.sh      # Script to run HAProxy in Docker
       └── haproxy.cfg         # HAProxy configuration file

## How to Run

1. **Step 1: Run HAProxy**
  - Use the provided script to run HAProxy in a Docker container. From the root directory, execute:
    ```bash
    ./resources/haproxy/haproxy-run.sh
    ```
  - This command will start HAProxy with the necessary configuration for request routing.

2. **Step 2: Start GraftNode**
  - Start the GraftNode server using the example configuration file:
    ```bash
    go run main.go --config resources/config-example.yaml
    ```
  - The server will listen on port 8000 and bind the `/hello` backend to HAProxy.
3. **Test the Setup**:
    - Use the `resources/test.sh` script to simulate requests and initiate the activities described:
        - The script will send a `curl` request to `http://localhost/hello`, triggering GraftNode to start the service instance.
        - Once the service is running, HAProxy will replace the initial configuration and forward future requests directly to the newly launched service.
    - Run the script:
      ```bash
      ./resources/test.sh
      ```
